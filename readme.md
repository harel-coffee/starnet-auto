# Cross-tissue co-expression networks in STARNET

Repository for STARNET cross-tissue analyses of data on multitissue gene expression and genotyping of patients with Coronary Artery Disease. The project uses weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA) across multiple tissues, followed by GENIE3 for inference of gene regulatory networks, which are analyzed by weighted key driver analysis (Mergeomics R package).
In addition, we construct a directed supernetwork of co-expression module eigengenes to model the progression of disease states. We also infer endocrine signaling from cross-tissue co-expression patterns.

Note that the code base includes legacy analyses, not included in the final manuscript. The associated paper published in Nature Cardiovascular Research is available at:
